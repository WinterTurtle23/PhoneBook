One of the major task in this project was displaying the added contacts in ascending order of their name.
For this, first the input is taken from user and sorted and then added to the Node.

In future build, there will be options to add more than one phone number for one name.
Also to delete a specific phone number when multiple numbers will be saved in one contact.
